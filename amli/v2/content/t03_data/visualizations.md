# What is NumPy?

* Package for scientific computing with Python
* Add support for n-dimensional array object, numpy.array
* Include high-level mathematical functions to operate on numpy.array
* Community supported open source project
* More info: http://www.numpy.org/

<!--
Numpy array is similar but not the same as Python array - mostly because numpy array offers much more functionalities, especially as it relates to computing of multidimensional array or matrices.
In this example, we shows the code for creating a sample 1-dimension, 2-dimension, and 3-dimension arrays:
For simplicity, the code use np.arange() function to get a list of evenly spaced number given an start and stop numbers, for example: np.arange(6) results in an array of number 0 to 5
To get 2-dimension and 3-dimension, we pass the 1-dimension array returned by np.arange() through np.reshape() function:
np.reshape(4.3) change the shape of the 1-d array into 4 by 3 2-d array
np.reshape(2,3,4) change the shape of the 1-d array into 2 arrays of 3 by 4

# Data Visualization

* Important steps in exploring the dataset(s)
* Many Python visualization libraries including Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Integrated to work with Pandas data structures
* Support a large variety of chart types
