# How to Play:

1. Count off to form random groups of 3-4 students.
1. Each team should tear their blank sheet of notebook paper into four and write **A** on one, then **B**, **C**, and **D** on the other three.
1. Each slide will contain one question. Your team will have **30 seconds** to deliberate and decide on your collective answer. 
1. Each team will display their answer at the same time. Each correct answer gets **one point**. No points will be deducted for wrong answers.
1. A final question will be worth **five points**.
1. You may not reference outside materials. Laptops down and cell phones off!
1. Let’s get started!

# 1.) Which of these events occurred first?

a. George Boole created a form of algebra in which all values can be reduced to “true” or “false.” Essential to modern computing, Boolean logic helps a CPU decide how to process new inputs.

b. Inspired by how humans follow specific processes to perform tasks, English logician and cryptanalyst Alan Turing theorized how a machine might decipher and execute a set of instructions. The publication of his theory is considered the basis of computer science.

c. Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines.

d. Neuroscientist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts wrote a paper on how human neurons might work. To illustrate the theory, they modeled a neural network with electrical circuits.
