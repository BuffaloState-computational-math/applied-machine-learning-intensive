# Capstone Project Introduction

---

# Project Goals

* Apply ML concepts and working with data skills learned in the past weeks on a sizeable data and challenging problem
* Apply professional development skills including working in a group with different personalities, giving and receiving feedback, communicating results, and project management

# Deliverables

**1. Design doc (50 pts)**
* Goal(s) for the project - ideal long term, and realistic for the project duration
* Describe the dataset(s), data acquisition, and data preparation
* Explain problem space and motivated questions
* Approach and list of tasks

**2. Ethical storyboarding worksheet (50 pts)**
* Colab/codes (100 pts)
* If code is in GitHub, include the URL to the GitHub repository
* Add code comments as documentation for each distinct code block
* Describing the purpose, an overview of how it works, and how to interpret results
* Discuss current limitations and future improvements (if applicable)

**3. Project demo or presentation (50 pts)**
* Conclusions and findings
* Things that went well and did not go well, and lessons learned
* Next steps (if applicable)

# Project Schedule

**Week 1:**
* Form your team 
* Explore and pick project datasets
* Brainstorm problem space and motivating question(s) that you’d like ML to help solve
* Write a design doc on how you approach building the ML model

**Week 2:**
* Get feedback/review on your design doc from guest speaker(s)
* Create a high level project plan of who’s doing what tasks by when
* Acquire & prep your dataset
* Start defining and training  your ML model
* Friday afternoon lightning talks: project status, share interesting things that you found, lessons learned, etc.

**Week 3:**
* Use data to validate your model, and start using your model for prediction
* Last pivot opportunities (if needed)
* Friday mid project status check-in: (project status update, share issues and resolutions, tips, useful tools
* Group meeting with instructor team
* Individual meeting with instructor team
**Week 4:**
* Final iterations on model predictions
* Friday afternoon lightning talks: project status, share interesting things that you found, lessons learned, etc.

**Week 5**
* Review results and prepare conclusions
* Put together your project presentation or demo
