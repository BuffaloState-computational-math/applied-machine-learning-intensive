# Detail Design/Ideas
Detail write ups on design approaches, ideas/experiment planned, requirements, timeline/schedule, etc.

Tips:
* Focus on design, not implementation
* A picture is worth a thousand words.  A diagram or drawing of the data and model at times is much easier to understand than words
* If describing alternatives, eg: approach, platform, algorithm - explain why it’s not part of the design
* Do go back and update it during implementation you took a different approach that originally designed
