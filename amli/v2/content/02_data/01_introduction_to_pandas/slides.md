# What is Pandas?

* Open source data analysis tool for Python programming language
* In use in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including Finance, Neuroscience, Economics, Statistics, Advertising, and more

<!--

Python is popular language for working on files and data munging, but to more data analysis and modeling means switching to a more domain specific language like R.
Pandas provide data structures and tools to perform data analysis.  Hence by combining Python and Pandas, you will be able to carry out the entire data analysis workflow using Python.

# Why Pandas?

* Good for data manipulation
* As you might have noticed when making visualizations, while we were able to represent the data, we were not modifying it in any way.
  * Pandas offers us this capability

<!--

Motivation: 
Situating pandas within the rest of the course for students and contrasting it with previous work so they can see why it’s useful

For the class:
Sometimes the data we get is not in the right format for what we need, so Pandas can help us change that.

# Pandas Data Structures

Dataframes are set up like tables, with columns, column headers, and rows of data.

<!--

Motivation: 
Giving a visual for the Dataframes so students who are visual learners can interact intuitively with the structure.

For the class:
* Pandas data structure is very much like a table with one or more columns - which means it works well with CSV type of data file format.
* Let’s start with a data structure: DataFrame
  * Looks like a table which consists of rows and columns
  * The first row contains column headers
