# CD-12: Navigating the Offer Process

<!--
This is our last career development session together, and I’m going to close by providing some guidance regarding what to do after you’ve successfully made it through an interview process and a company is interested in hiring you. This is a great place to be in, but it can come with its own stressors, especially if you’re considering moving to a new place, weighing different offers, and/or wondering what salary you should be aiming for.

# Common questions in the offer process

* I’m about to be faced with one of the biggest decisions I’ve ever had to make. How do I know I’m making the right choice for me? 
* Should I aim high or play it safe with the preferred salary range I communicate?
* My offers have so many components and acronyms I don’t understand (RSU, PTO, 401k). What do all these things mean? 
* How do I go about negotiating my offers? 

<!--
These are some questions students typically have around this time, and in today’s session we aim to answer them.

[Ask four different student volunteers to read the questions on the slide.]

# Different paths to success
## take these recommendations as suggestions

<!--
Before jumping in any further, I want to highlight that this session is a collection of thoughts and experiences of a few career technical recruiters who put this together. All of these are recommendations, not requirements for a successful hiring process. You are all unique people with different values, needs, location preferences, families, priorities, etc. Please take from this what you find helpful and discard what doesn’t align with your individual needs/preferences.

# 1.) Finding a good fit

<!--
Let’s chat about what makes a company a good fit for you specifically. You might be thinking, “I’m not picky. I just need a job and health insurance!” I hear that. You may very well find yourself deciding between multiple offers when the time comes, though, and it’s important to be able to measure those offers against your own priorities and values to make the right decision for your next step.

**What exactly is corporate culture?** {.big}

*Corporate culture* refers to the beliefs and behaviors that determine how a company's employees and management interact and handle outside business transactions. Often, corporate culture is implied, not expressly defined, and develops organically over time from the cumulative traits of the people the company hires.


Ideally corporate culture aligns with one’s personal values

<!--
Based on your understanding, how would you define “corporate culture”? [Solicit and respond to student contributions.]

[Click to allow definition to appear.]

What does corporate culture have to do with our values exercise from the last session? [Solicit and respond to student contributions.]

Yes, ideally corporate culture aligns with the personal values of the people working there. As an example, Google’s corporate culture incorporates the values of openness, innovation, comfort with ambiguity, collaboration. Another company’s might be transparency, results-focused, leadership, and specialization. Another’s might be simplicity, design, secrecy, and product excellence. We can’t always know a company’s culture from the outside, but talking with people who have worked there, speaking with recruiters, conducting informational interviews, and interning at a company are all great ways to learn about a company’s culture.

**Corporate culture vs. your wants and needs** {.big}

From our last session, what is most important to you?

<!--
Thinking back to our last session’s value discussion or otherwise, what are some of the things that you find most important when thinking about your future career/employer? 

[Solicit student contributions and respond to each.]

[Click to display list.]

There are countless factors that might play into an individual’s wants and needs, and the list we looked at in our last session is much longer than this one. But these are some things people value the most when it comes to their work and workplace. This list is by no means exhaustive, but it does include some of Harvard Business Reviews “6 Components of a Great Corporate Culture” and Time’s “Top 10 reasons people stay at their jobs.” 

What on this list, or not on this list, resonates most with you?

[Solicit student contributions.]

Excellent. As we can see just from our small group, people have different priorities and values when it comes to their work. Let’s take a look at two people on the job hunt whose values differ substantially...

**Different values at work** {.big}

![](res/offer02.png)

<!--
This slide represents two different word clouds emphasizing the relative importance of the same set of values through the eyes of two undergraduate students looking for full-time jobs. You can see in the yellow/green cloud on the left the words that stand out: recognition, camaraderie, benefits, pay, commitment to learning. In the blue/purple cloud on the right the focus is slightly different: vision, family, values, diversity, consistency. Though some of the priorities do overlap, it is less than likely that the “perfect” or “dream” work environment for both of these students will be the same job on the same team at the same company.

**Your values at wrok** {.big}

* Consider
  * Reflect on your values, where you’re willing to live, whether your values align with certain roles and organizations
* Identify
  * Know what your potential deal breakers might be 
* Take Action
  * Leverage career fairs, LinkedIn, former interns, recruiters, company events to learn more about companies
  
<!--
So how do you factor your values into your decision of where to work?

First, CONSIDER your values (along with your skills and career goals) when you decide where to apply. It’s not a good use of your time to apply somewhere where you wouldn’t work. Consider where you’re willing to live and the work you want to do before pursuing roles that aren’t in line.

Next, IDENTIFY any factors that are deal breakers in your job selection process. For example, if you’re applying to companies in a certain area but know that you realistically won’t move there -- that’s a deal breaker. Maybe a clear path to management is important to you. Maybe an equity-focused mission is a must-have. As you can see, these are unique to you. 

If you are still unsure if your values align with those of a company, TAKE ACTION by attending company events and connecting with current employees, if possible. This is also a great opportunity to reach out to LinkedIn connections you already have or new ones via the college/university alumni search filter we used in an earlier session. These provide an opportunity to ask strategic questions to help you determine the list of companies you want to apply to.

# 2.) Developing a salary range

<!--
Next we’ll talk about a topic that can be sensitive and often generates hearty debate! Some of you may have already engaged in conversations with recruiters or hiring managers about salary ranges, which makes this especially timely and relevant. If you haven’t, tuck these suggestions away for the future.

As I mentioned in the beginning of this presentation, take from these slides what feels appropriate to you and most importantly -- do your research. Your interview and application processes SHOULD involve substantial research, planning, and thought. This presentation is a jumping off point for that research and thought, not an answer to all related questions.

**Factors to consider** {.big}

* Location
    * Cost of living and labor can vary tremendously across U.S. cities
    * NerdWallet’s Cost of Living Calculator can help you determine what a comparable salary would be in another city given cost of living
* Your Professional & Educational Experiences 
    * Your salary will likely be less than someone in a similar position who has more years of work experience and/or more education
Industry
Your potential employer also has a range in mind
It’s based on what they already pay people in similar roles and the pay scales of competitors. Still, do your research!
