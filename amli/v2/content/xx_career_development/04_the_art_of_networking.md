# CD-04: The Art of Networking

<!--
Today we’re going to talk about the art of networking. If you’re thinking of a LAN, WAN, or MAN or linking computers together, we’re actually talking about a different type of networking today. But DO hold on to the idea of creating a connection or link between two things- in this case, between people.

# What is networking?

Interacting meaningfully with other people to exchange information and develop contacts, especially to further one’s career.

<!--
* As a student, you’ll begin having many opportunities to begin making connections with others and building your network, so now is a great time to begin learning the skills of networking.
* Many people believe that networking is something you’re born with; some people are just better than others. The truth is that anyone can learn how to network effectively and you’ll also improve a lot with practice, and I will make sure to work some time in for some practice today.

# Where does networking take place?

Both formal and informal settings:
* Career fairs
* On-campus events
* Affinity groups
* Family events
* Anywhere - coffee shops, elevators, riding the bus, and through many kinds of activities

<!--
* You may be thinking that networking only takes place in formal settings - at a career fair, or an actual advertised “networking” event. While that’s true and you should be extra prepared for those kinds of events where you KNOW networking will be explicitly taking place, you may be surprised to learn that meaningful networking can be accomplished almost anywhere. Definitely through on campus events like a visiting speaker or activity, and through affinity groups you may join now or after college, like an Alumnae group. 
* But networking can also happen in places you visit all the time, like in your daily commute, at Starbucks, or even at your next family event.
* You never know who you’ll meet, which is why you should practice networking skills so you’ll be absolutely ready to network whenever you meet people who could be helpful to you, or to whom you could be helpful.
* Feel free to share your own examples here: (one from Meggie) “I was on the Airtrain to JFK and ran into an NYU student who saw my Google bag and asked enthusiastically about if I worked for Google. We had a great conversation and after finding out he was in CS, I gave him my email and connected him to the NYU specialist. He didn't get an internship but it was a great experience for him to practice pitching himself and skills to potential contacts/employers.”
  * Great time to also discuss reading social cues and making sure it’s an appropriate to discuss
  * E.g. if someone looks busy or is not receptive don’t continue
* Being authentic and letting your true self shine through: most important

# What does networking consist of?

* Introduction
* Pleasantries
* Listening closely
* Asking questions
* Deciding on some next step, or making a request/offer
* Exchange contact information
* Following up

<!--
* In a more formal setting, like a career fair where everyone is there expecting to hear about opportunities, networking would probably be more formulaic - you would introduce yourself - who you are and what you study or are there for, perhaps make a bit of small talk depending on if others are waiting (the weather, have they visited here before, are they an alumna?) and then asking questions, listening closely, and either an offer to follow up, or maybe a request from you before parting. Then, you’d need to follow up on whatever was decided. 
* For instance, if you got to a career fair, you may walk up and say “Hi! How are you?”, followed by a tiny bit of small talk and then “I’m NAME, a senior at Spelman College, studying Computer Science. I’m interested in summer internships - is your company offering any summer internships in software engineering?” You can listen carefully and ask follow up questions, including asking if the representative will take your resume, or if you should email it. You should also ask for a card or a way to stay in contact, and then make a request “May I send you my resume for you to review?” or “May I follow up with you directly on the opportunities you mentioned?” or the rep may say “I’ll email you with opportunities”. Either way, you’ve decided on next steps and you would take go home, and send a thank you email or any next step you decided on.

# Networking DOs and DON'Ts

![](res/artofnetworking02.png)

In the next few slides, we will go over ways to effectively network, as well as some things that may detract from building a good network.

1. DO: use technology to network {.big}

* Thanks to technology, networking has never been easier
* But using the right technology to network can be confusing
  * Email, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter?
  * Use technology, but then step away!
* Follow up promptly after discussing opportunities in a networking context
  * Give context! Remind them of your name and any specifics of your convo
     1. “I was also a Girl Scout Gold Award recipient and I love coding in Java.”
  * Try to follow up within two days
  
<!--
* If you can believe it, you used to have to exchange paper resumes to network professionally, which made everything much slower and more complicated
* Now, thanks to technology, we can network with one another more easily than ever before using a myriad of platforms.
* The down side of that is that with so many options for connecting, it can be difficult to decide the right one. Social media is messy. Across Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social networks, we are connected to a mix of close friends, college buddies, high school classmates, co-workers, bosses, former bosses, I-met-you-at-a-party-once acquaintances, and people we've never even seen face-to-face. It's important to understand the particular platform that you're using, as well as the type of relationship you have with a person, before attempting to leverage that connection for professional gain. Each social media platform has a certain reputation. For instance, LinkedIn is generally a business site, while Twitter is more "laid back" and often mixes professional and personal content. Respect the way that people use these sites. Adding a professional acquaintance as a friend on Facebook can be invasive, especially if that individual is a traditionalist who uses Facebook purely for personal contact with friends and family. Likewise, asking an old friend for a recommendation on LinkedIn might create awkwardness if the person has no experience with you in a professional capacity. LinkedIn is the quintessential social media site for forging business and work connections. Twitter can be a useful tool for interacting with the business as a whole, or for keeping up with their work, while Facebook and Instagram are more personal outlets.
* Also, while technology is great for staying in touch and keeping track of contacts, nothing is substitute for a face-to-face conversation and interaction, so whenever possible, be sure to schedule time to actually talk. Social networking is a way to keep track of relationships, but is not necessarily a way to build lasting relationships.
* Along the same lines, when you meet someone through social media, ask for their preferred method of contact. Some people are big e-mailers, while others love talking on the phone or meeting for coffee. Respect their preferences.

2. DON'T: come across as transactional {.big}

* Don’t approach contacts only when you need a favor
* Do look for ways to support the other person
* Make networking a two-way street, be conversational
* Pay it forward

<!--
* Continuously look for ways to give back to the people in your online networks. 
* Don't approach them only when you need a favor. Reach out to say hello or to contribute something you think will be valuable to them. 
* Networking is a two-way street. Plus, in the end, it's your reputation that counts.
* Also, because you will benefit from networking, look for ways to also help others. Opportunities to help colleagues who may be younger than you or even just in need of networking help themselves will increase as you become more successful. Whether you pay it forward by introducing a friend to a contact you think could be helpful to them or eventually become a mentor yourself, it completes the full cycle when you’re also in a place to give back to others.
* (Consider using a real world example of inappropriate use of calling people, LinkedIn requests, etc)
-->

3.) DO: make a specific request {.big}

* Vagueness can lead to a lack of results
* Be respectful of someone’s time
* Make a specific “ask”
* Never just send your resume - always make a note with a specific request

<!--
* When you approach someone for career help via social media, know what you want out of the interaction and ask specific questions that show you've done your research. Often, people send messages along the lines of "I'm looking to go into marketing. Any advice or leads would be greatly appreciated!" or "Can you tell me more about this job?" in a Twitter DM. These types of messages are so broad that it's difficult to provide a meaningful and relevant response.
* Working professionals are strapped for time. Make it easy for them to help you — specify what you're looking for. Is it the person's time? Connections to certain individuals? Advice on a particular topic? Knowledge about a company? Do you want them to act as a reference? Introduce you to a recruiter at their organization? Provide a critique of your resume?
  * Example: do not email a recruiter and say “I’m a junior CS student - where does my profile fit within Google?
  * What you could say is: I have a Math minor and know from reading that Chrome needs engineers with this background. Do you think there would be opportunities for me here? 
* You need to showcase your skills and value, show us you’ve done their research on roles and qualifications, and ask specific questions when you have them.
-->

4.) DO: personalize all communication {.big}

* Do your homework! Make sure to check the the spelling of a person’s name, title, organization, and all other details
  * Also make sure you have the right gender pronoun, when unsure, just use their name instead
* Express appreciation for their time and interest
* Explain why you want to connect

<!--
* It will be important to your career going forward to have great attention to detail and to show this is something important to you, and you do that by showing you have done research
* Tips: pay attention to detail, and if you know this is challenging for you, have a friend proofread important emails or read aloud to make sure everything makes sense before sending.
* From LinkedIn connection requests to advice-seeking Facebook messages to 140-character chatter on Twitter, you should customize every communication sent on social networks. It shows that you value your unique connection with the recipient. It's easy for people to feel used when you send them a generic request or a message that's clearly copy-and-pasted to dozens of others (especially if you forget to change the names!).
* For existing connections, express an understanding and appreciation for the relationship. When you reach out for advice, give consideration to the other person. Ask pertinent questions about them, especially if you've been out of touch for a while. Be honest and open. When requesting a recommendation on LinkedIn, for example, always customize your request to reflect how you value the person's endorsement.
* For new relationships, explain why you want to connect with this particular individual. What is it about her background that makes her an appealing person to talk to? Show that you've done your homework. Know about the person's work history and professional accomplishments, as well as anything career-related you two have in common. Never send an introductory message to a potential connection asking, "So, what exactly does your company do?"

Practice A - when you are following up with someone you met briefly {.big}

You made some polite small talk and then exchanged business cards with this person at a networking event. Now—rather than letting that contact information collect dust in your desk drawer—you want to take the next step to forge a relationship.

What are some things we want to include as we craft this email?

<!--
**Ask a student to read the slide. Before clicking on the next slide, get some answers from the audience. Possible ideas:
* Reference where you met**
* Reference something you talked about
* An ask - share an article, share you resume, ask a question about where they work, continue the conversation...etc

Practice A [Template]

Hello [Name],

I hope you’re having a great [day of the week].


It was so nice to meet you at [place where you met] and chat about [topic you talked about]. After our conversation, I found this article about [relevant topic]. I thought you’d find it interesting, so I figured I’d pass it along.


Again, I really enjoyed meeting you and I’m looking forward to keeping in touch. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to get together and bounce around some more ideas about [topic]. I’d love that!

<!--
This template is an example and certainly not the only way to follow up after meeting someone. Maybe you chatted about a particular resource, book, professor, product launch, study, job description, or any other thing you said you’d pass along. An article is just one way of working to begin solidifying the connection and not letting it drop off.
