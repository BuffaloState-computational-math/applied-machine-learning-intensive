# Capstone Project Introduction

---

# Project Goals

* Apply technical ML concepts and data skills learned in the first half of the course on a sizeable dataset and challenging problem
* Demonstrate professional development skills, such as working in a group with different personalities, giving and receiving feedback, communicating results, and project management
* Create and facilitate a recorded demo or presentation of capstone project work

---

# Deliverables

**1. Design doc**
* Goal(s) for the project - ideal long term, and realistic for the project duration
* Describe the dataset(s), data acquisition, and data preparation
* Explain problem space and motivated questions
* Approach and list of tasks
* Who will play what roles (program manager, note taker) during each project phase

**2. Ethical storyboarding worksheet**
* Colab/codes (100 pts)
* If code is in GitHub, include the URL to the GitHub repository
* Add code comments as documentation for each distinct code block
* Describing the purpose, an overview of how it works, and how to interpret results
* Discuss current limitations and future improvements (if applicable)

**3. Project demo or presentation**
* Conclusions and findings
* Things that went well and did not go well, and lessons learned
* Next steps (if applicable)

# Datasets

Your project team has the option of using one of the datasets below, some of which we have used before, or finding your own dataset:

* [IMDB Movie reviews sentiment classification](https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification) Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative).
* [Boston housing price regression dataset](https://keras.io/datasets/#boston-housing-price-regression-dataset) Dataset taken from the StatLib library, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. Samples contain 13 attributes of houses at different locations around the Boston suburbs in the late 1970s.
* [NOAA GSOD dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/gsod) Daily global surface summary from over 9000 weather stations from 1929 to 2016 maintained by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
* [UC Irvine ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) A collection of datasets including Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Business, CS/Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.
* [Google BigQuery Public dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/) Readily available copies of public datasets including Github actions, US births, Shakespeare, Wikipedia revision history, etc.
* [Google AI Datasets](https://ai.google/tools/datasets/) A collection of datasets with wide-ranging topics.
* [dataCommons](https://browser.datacommons.org/) Constructed by synthesizing a single Knowledge Graph from many different data sources. It currently contains data from Wikipedia, the US Census, NOAA, FBI, etc.

Alternatively, you can use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [Google Public Data Explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory) to search for an interesting dataset for your project.

# Project Timeline

**Phase 1:**
* Form your team 
* Explore and pick project datasets
* Brainstorm problem space and motivating question(s) that you’d like ML to help solve
* Write a design doc on how you approach building the ML model

**Phase 2:**
* Get feedback/review on your design doc from guest speaker(s)
* Create a high level project plan of who’s doing what tasks by when
* Acquire & prep your dataset
* Start defining and training  your ML model
* Friday afternoon lightning talks: project status, share interesting things that you found, lessons learned, etc.

**Phase 3:**
* Use data to validate your model, and start using your model for prediction
* Last pivot opportunities (if needed)
* Friday mid project status check-in: 
  * project status update
  * share issues and resolutions, tips, useful tools
  * Group meeting with instructor team
  * Individual meeting with instructor team

**Phase 4:**
* Final iterations on model predictions
* Friday afternoon lightning talks: project status, share interesting things that you found, lessons learned, etc.

**Phase 5**
* Review results and prepare conclusions
* Put together your project presentation or demo

# Final Presentations

* Project demo or presentation should adhere to the following format and cover all the points here:
  * Overview of the project and the problem it seeks to solve, if applicable
  * Conclusions and findings
  * Things that went well, things that did not go well, and lessons learned
  * Next steps, if applicable
* Presentations should be 15 minutes each and include time for questions. Each member of the team should present for some amount of time. 
* Presentations should be visually interesting but also follow best practices for verbal presentation skills. Namely, it is important for all points to be conveyed clearly. 
* You will have a chance to practice presenting for the instructional team during the 2-3 days leading up to final presentations.
