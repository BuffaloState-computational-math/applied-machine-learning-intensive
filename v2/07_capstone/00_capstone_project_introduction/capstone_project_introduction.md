# Capstone Project Introduction

---

# Project Goals

* Apply technical ML concepts and data skills learned in the first half of the course on a sizeable dataset and challenging problem
* Demonstrate professional development skills, such as working in a group with different personalities, giving and receiving feedback, communicating results, and project management
* Create and facilitate a recorded demo or presentation of capstone project work

---

# Capstone Project Deliverables

1. Design doc - 20%
1. Ethical storyboarding worksheet - 10%
1. Notebook - 50%
1. Project demo or presentation - 20%

# Capstone Project Deliverables

**1.) Design doc - 20%**
* Goal(s) for the project - ideally long term, and realistic for the project duration
* Who will play what roles (program manager, note taker) during each project phase
* Describe the dataset(s), data acquisition, and data preparation
* Explain problem space and motivated questions
* Approach and list of tasks

**2.) Ethical storyboarding worksheet - 10%**

**3.) Notebook - 50%**
* The notebook should read like a formal report and follow a linear flow from start to finish with both narrative and code blocks. 
* The notebook should be internally complete in the sense that a “reader” should understand the motivating question, goals, dataset, model, and ethical considerations. 
* Markdown cells with narrative should precede and follow each code block.
* For each piece of code, describe the purpose, an overview of how it works, and how to interpret results.
* Discuss current limitations and future improvements (if applicable).

**4.) Project demo or presentation - 20%**
* Overview of the project and the problem it seeks to solve (if applicable)
* Conclusions and findings
* Things that went well, things that did not go well, and lessons learned
* Next steps (if applicable)

# Datasets

Your project team has the option of using one of the datasets below, some of which we have used before, or finding your own dataset:

* [IMDB Movie reviews sentiment classification](https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification) Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative).
* [Boston housing price regression dataset](https://keras.io/datasets/#boston-housing-price-regression-dataset) Dataset taken from the StatLib library, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. Samples contain 13 attributes of houses at different locations around the Boston suburbs in the late 1970s.
* [NOAA GSOD dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/gsod) Daily global surface summary from over 9000 weather stations from 1929 to 2016 maintained by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
* [UC Irvine ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) A collection of datasets including Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Business, CS/Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.
* [Google BigQuery Public dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/) Readily available copies of public datasets including Github actions, US births, Shakespeare, Wikipedia revision history, etc.
* [Google AI Datasets](https://ai.google/tools/datasets/) A collection of datasets with wide-ranging topics.
* [dataCommons](https://browser.datacommons.org/) Constructed by synthesizing a single Knowledge Graph from many different data sources. It currently contains data from Wikipedia, the US Census, NOAA, FBI, etc.

Alternatively, you can use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [Google Public Data Explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory) to search for an interesting dataset for your project.

# Project Timeline

## Phases 1-2 of 4

**Project Phase 1**
* Form teams
* Explore and pick project topics
* Write a design doc on how you approach building the ML model
* Create a high level project plan of who’s doing what tasks by when

**Project Phase 2**
* Acquire & prep dataset
* Start defining and training your ML model
* Beginning project presentation: discuss acquiring data, exploratory data analysis, and justification for first model

# Project Timeline

## Phases 3-4 of 4

**Project Phase 3**
* Use data to tune model and validate
* Mid project presentation: share iterations of model tuning with a focus on challenges and questions, welcome feedback from peers and instructors
* Group and individual meetings with the instructional team

**Project Phase 4**
* Final iterations on model predictions
* Review results and prepare conclusions
* Practice final presentation and demo, collect, and incorporate final  feedback

# Daily Schedule

Project teams work synchronously or asynchronously, but they must have daily meetings as a whole group. 

Sample daily schedule
* Morning team stand-ups 
* Project work (multi-hour block)
* (Optional) ad hoc topic session (at most 2-3 times per phase)
* Lunch
* Project work (multi-hour block)
* (Optional) professional skills session or guest speaker (at most 1 per phase)
* End of day team meetings and stand-ups

---

# Final Presentations

* Project demo or presentation should adhere to the following format and cover all the points here:
 * Overview of the project and the problem it seeks to solve, if applicable
 * Conclusions and findings
 * Things that went well, things that did not go well, and lessons learned
 * Next steps, if applicable
* Presentations should be 15 minutes each plus 5 minutes for questions. Each member of the team should present for roughly the same amount of time. 
* Presentations should be visually interesting but also follow best practices for verbal presentation skills. Namely, it is important for all points to be conveyed clearly. 
* You will have an opportunity to present to the instructional team during the 2-3 days leading up to final presentations. It's recommended that you incorporate their feedback.
