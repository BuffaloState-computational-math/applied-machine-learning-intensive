# Introduction to Image Classification

<!--
We have performed binary and multiclass classificaiton on datasets containing string and numeric values. In this unit we'll perform classification on images.
-->

# Image Features

<!--
What makes image classification different from other forms of classification? One major difference are the features. When classifying an image, each pixel is a features. How are these pixels represented?

# Image Features

<!--
So how are those pixels represented?

Often they are represented as RGB values. These are three numbers that indicate the amount of red, green, and blue in an image. These numbers often range from 0 to 255.

# Image Features

How many features would we have for a 1920 Ã— 1920 images if the image was represented by RGB values?

<!--
Let's take a moment to think about the number of features that we are dealing with there. Say that we have a 1920 by 1920 pixel image. How many features would we have?
-->

---

# Image Features

$$ 1920 * 1920 * 3 = 11,059,200 $$

<!--
That's over 11 million input features!
-->

---

# Image Features

How many features would we have for a 12 megapixel image stored in RGB?

<!--
Let's try another one. How many features would we have for a 12 megapixel image stored in RGB?

This resolution (or greater) is common in our mobile phones.
-->

---

# Image Features

$$ 12,000,000 * 3 = 36,000,000 $$

<!--
This is an insanely huge number of features. No model could handle that many features and still be performant. That is why you'll noticed that the images that we use in this lab are very low resolution.
-->

# Image Features: Grayscale

<!--
Another way to reduce the number of features is to convert them to grayscale. Grayscal uses a single number to represent the intensity of color in a pixel, but doesn't specify which color. The range of values that you'll find vary. In this lab we work with one dataset that has a grayscale range of 0 through 255 and another that goes from 0 through 16. Grayscale values might even be in the range from 0.0 through 1.0. For neural networks this smaller range is easier to train on.

# Image Features: Other Formats

* HSV: Hue, Saturation, Value
* HSL: Hue, Saturation, Light
* CMYK: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black
* BGR: Blue, Green Red

<!--
There are more color models than RGB and Grayscale. A few alternatives are listed in this slide.

You'll notice that some, like CMYK, have more values than RGB. Others, like BGR, is just RGB in a differnt order.

# Image Classification: Busy Images

![center](res/street.jpg)

<!--
Another interesting aspect of image classification is that rarely do images contain just a single item. Take this image for instance. It contains builds, cars, people, and more.

# Image Classification: Lab

![center](res/shirt.png)

<!--
In this introduction to image classification we'll be working with some very curated datasets. The first dataset that we work with is the MNIST Fashion dataset.

The dataset contains 70,000 images of different clothing items. Each image is a grayscale image, only contains one item, and is only 28x28 pixels.

# Image Classification: Lab

> Label	| Class
> ------|------------
> 0     | T-shirt/top
> 1     | Trouser
> 2     | Pullover
> 3     | Dress
> 4     | Coat
> 5     | Sandal
> 6     | Shirt
> 7     | Sneaker
> 8     | Bag
> 9     | Ankle boot

<!--
The images in the Fashion MNIST dataset are labeled with one of the shown classes. The numeric label is the target of the model.

<!--
We'll also work with the MNIST digits dataset. This dataset contains handwritten digits that we'll classify as 0 through 9. This is also a very clean dataset with one digit per image.
