# Video Processing Project

<!--
We are about to combine many of the skills that we have learned over the past few units. We will take a video file and a pre-trained model and we will build bouding boxes around items in each frame of the video.

In this project we will process a video frame-by-frame and attempt to create bounding boxes around items found in those image by the third-party model.
