# Regression With TensorFlow

<!--
We have created numerous regression models in this course using both
scikit-learn and TensorFlow. These models have all be "classic" models,
but that is about to change.

In this unit we are going to build a regression model using a deep neural
network. The model will take feature data, pass it through hidden neural network
layers, and output a continuous value.

# Keras

## The Python Deep Learning Library

<!--
To build our deep neural network we will be using Keras, a high-level Python API
that can be used within TensorFlow.

Don't be put off by the term "deep neural network". Though the math and the
theory are complex, the actual code that you need to write to create one is as
easy as creating a linear regression.
