## Overview

Use this document as a guide for creating good discussions in the classroom.

## Ask good questions

*   Ask open ended questions
    *   Ask questions that require thought, have a variety of potential answers,
        and ask students to apply what they are learning to a particular
        situation.
    *   Ex: What is the best tool we have to visualize that data, and why?
*   Stay away from yes-or-no questions
    *   These types of questions do not lead to discussion, and may put pressure
        on students to feel like there is a “right” and “wrong” answer.
    *   Instead of “Are there any questions?” ask “Are there any questions about
        [specific topic or point of discussion]?”
*   Apply content to students’ lives
    *   Pose questions where students apply the concepts to hypotheticals they
        may face in their careers.
    *   Have students share their personal experience with the topic if they are
        comfortable.
*   Ask about process
    *   Have students explain their reasoning or thought process (especially for
        a technical topic).

## Hear from Everyone

*   Provide the discussion questions ahead of time
    *   Particularly helpful for English language learners and students nervous
        about speaking in front of their peers for any reason.
*   Small group and pair discussion
    *   Smaller group discussions are less stressful than commenting before the
        entire class, and can be a good warm up activity to a larger class
        discussion.
    *   Think-Pair-Share: Have students spend a few minutes thinking on their
        own, then have them share their answers with their partners.
    *   Share Your Neighbor’s Question or Comment: Asking students to share one
        of their group members’ ideas leverages your dominant talkers to hear
        more student viewpoints. Sharing a group members’ question can also
        lessen the vulnerability involved in asking their own questions.
*   Online discussion before class
    *   Students from underrepresented groups may suffer from impostor syndrome,
        doubting their own abilities and their deserving to be on campus.
        Calling on students who made strong or interesting discussion posts can
        bolster confidence. See other benefits below.
*   Max/Min speaking time
    *   As students enter the classroom, they each pick up three poker chips.
        When they speak, they return a poker chip. Once they’ve used up their
        three chips, they may no longer contribute. To make sure everyone
        participates, require all students to use up some portion of their chips
        by the end of class, or each week.

## Make Sure They’re Prepared

*   Set discussion norms
    *   Agree as a group on guidelines for participation. Make sure students
        will feel safe expressing their ideas in the group.
*   Provide the discussion questions ahead of time
    *   Having discussion questions before completing the reading aids in
        identification of key concepts and supporting facts.
*   Online discussion or quiz before class
    *   Ensures reading happens before class, and gives more time for students
        to collect their thoughts. Other benefits above and below.
*   “Warm up” to discussion
    *   Having students complete a short (1-5 min) writing exercise on the topic
        or small group discussion will help focus them on the topic for
        discussion.

## Develop Critical Thinking and Strong Arguments

*   Group analysis of online discussion or quiz answers
    *   Go over particularly strong student responses and have a class
        discussion on what makes this a particularly strong response.
    *   Bring up an interesting idea and ask the group what evidence could be
        added to strengthen their point.
    *   Cover common mistakes (without naming names). Have students work in
        pairs or small groups to identify what went wrong and offer help for
        improvement.
*   Summarize before moving on
    *   Make sure to summarize the key topics before moving on - especially if
        the class got off topic! Focus on contributions from students.
    *   Ex: “Liz brought up a great point about the relationship between A and
        B, and Carl pointed out that the relationship between A and B may not be
        causal. Juni then suggested a possible lurking variable C. “
*   Wait time
    *   Pause to give students time to reflect on your questions, summaries, or
        other students’ comments. Students may be formulating a response or
        building the courage to respond, especially if responding directly to
        each other.
*   Muddiest point
    *   In the last few minutes of class, have students write briefly about the
        topic that was the most confusing or unclear. This encourages
        metacognition about what they understood and had trouble with, in
        addition to giving the instructor information about topics to revisit.

## Other Considerations

*   Do not ask anyone to speak for their particular demographic. It’s an unfair
    and impossible burden, and one person hardly represents an entire gender,
    race, or ethnicity. Invite sharing — just don’t treat a student as an
    authority who speaks for an entire class of people.
*   Do not criticize students or their responses (this can increase anxiety over
    participating). Describe what you saw or heard and invite the opinions of
    other students. Be factual and specific.
*   Do not assume a certain experience is shared by everyone.
    *   Ex: Not everyone has traveled out of the country, played a particular
        game, etc.
*   Know and use your students’ names. Make sure students also know each others’
    names.
*   Evaluate the discussion. Who did and did not participate (look for gender
    and racial biases)? Was the tone stimulating and respectful? How did
    students feel about the discussion?
