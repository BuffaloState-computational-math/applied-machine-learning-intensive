   :alt: A sheet is a table that's made up of cells. Cells have data in them, and they can be organized by columns or rows. Formulas are calculations you can do to get important information from the data, and they always start with an equal sign. Relative referencing is when you drag or copy and paste a formula to new cells and the cells being used in the formula update to use values relative to where the formula is. Absolute referencing is when you copy-paste a formula and the variables don't change. (ex. $A$1). Semi-absolute referencing is when the row in a formula stays the same, but the column updates, or when the column in a formula stays the same but the row updates (ex. A$1, $A1). A recursive formula is when you use a formula over and over, but with different inputs. Some useful functions to use on data: =AND(statement1, statement2), =IF(true or false condition, what to print if statement is TRUE, what to print if statement is FALSE). Some stps for debugging errors: Look at the error message (sometimes they're intuitive). Check that the inputs are right for that function. Google the error.
