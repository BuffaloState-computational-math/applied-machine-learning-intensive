Introduction
============

Now that Sheets is more familiar and you know how it can hold data, you will
learn how Sheets can also be used to organize that data. Sheets has functions
that allow you to **filter** as well as **group** data. For example, if you had
the table below you could use filtering and grouping to more easily display
certain data.

   :align: center
   :alt: Table containing basic data for 23 people.


Above is a table with some standard information collected from a group of 23
people. This data is fictional. Below is the same data from this table after
filtering and grouping are separately applied.

   :alt: The same table after applying a filter.


This is an example of **filtering** data to just see rows of people whose city
is Los Angeles.

This is an example of **grouping** the data to count the number of people in
this dataset who are from Los Angeles.

Don't worry if this is confusing. These examples are meant to help you become
more familiar with applications of filtering and grouping on a data set.
=======

**Can you guess what kind of grouping was used on the table?** 

The table was grouped using the `COUNTIF` function to count how many people have
their city listed as Los Angeles.

Don't worry if that was difficult. This exercise was to help get you more
familiar with potential uses for filtering and grouping on a data set.
