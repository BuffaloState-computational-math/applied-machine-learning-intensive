Introduction
============

Now that Sheets is more familiar and you know how it can hold data, you will
learn how Sheets can also be used to organize that data. Sheets has functions
that allow you to **filter** as well as **group** data. For example, if you had
the table below you could use filtering and grouping to more easily display
certain data.

   :alt: Table containing basic data for 23 people.


Above is a table with some standard information collected from a group of 23
people. This data is fictional. Below is the same data from this table after
filtering and grouping are separately applied.

**Can you guess what kind of filter was used on the table?** 

The filter applied selected the data for people whose city is "Los Angeles".


.. image:: figures/table_group_example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The same table after applying grouping.


**Can you guess what kind of grouping was used on the table?** 

The table was grouped using the `COUNTIF` function to count how many people have
their city listed as Los Angeles.

Don't worry if that was difficult. This exercise was to help get you more
familiar with potential uses for filtering and grouping on a data set.
