   :alt: An ordered categorical variable is a qualitative variable that has values with some kind of natural ranking (ex. grade). Types of variables: quantitative, which have number values, and qualitative, which have non-numberical values (Qualitative example: hair color. Quantitative example: height.) Types of quantitative variables (variables with number values): discrete variables, which only take certain values, and continuous variables, which take any value within a range. The count is the number of cells that have data in them. If there's numbers in those cells, sum adds them all up. The minimum value is the smallest value in the dataset, and the maximum value is the largest value in the dataset. In sheets they're calculated as =MIN(value1, value2) or =MAX(value1, value2). There are three measures of center: mean, median, and mode. The mean is the standard form of averaging, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most commonly occurring value in the data. An outlier is a data point that is significantly far away from most other data points. A large outlier creates a positive skew, and a small outlier creates a negative skew. The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out data points in a dataset are. It's calculated in sheets using =STDEVP(value1, value2, value3).
