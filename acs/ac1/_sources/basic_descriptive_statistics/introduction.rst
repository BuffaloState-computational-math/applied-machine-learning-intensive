Introduction
============

Statistics are everywhere: in news articles, sports, government reports, 
research papers, just to name a few. Using statistics is so popular because
they provide evidence and credibility to claims. Consider the following two sentences.

1. “Americans are spending a lot of time watching TV.” 
2. “Adult Americans are spending five hours and four minutes on average watching TV per day.” 

Although both sentences make the same point, the statistic used in the second sentence
makes the statement sound more persuasive. That statistic happens to be true, 
but the media and other sources will often misinterpret data to support the claim
they’re trying to make. Since the claims they make often impact the decisions you
make, it’s important for you to be able to critically assess those statistics.
On top of that, statistics allows you to support your own claims or drive your
own decision-making in any field of work or study.

Here are just a few examples of how a variety of fields use statistics:

-  Journalists use data to substantiate their reporting.
-  Political leaders use data to inform their decisions.
-  Sports teams and businesses lean heavily on statistical algorithms for their actions.
-  Psychologists use statistics to give meaning to the data they collected.

There are so many other fields that use statistics with so many other uses!
