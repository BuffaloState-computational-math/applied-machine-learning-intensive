Introduction
============

As mentioned in the preface, SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is
a programming language used to get, store, and change information that is in a
database. SQL is one of the most widely used programming languages today. It can
be used in any field where there is data.

You may be wondering how this is different from the sheets you have just learned
about. However, how would you handle the case where your spreadsheet had
millions or billions of cells of data? Would you want to scroll down and load
all that data? Well, this is where SQL comes in. SQL does many of the things
that you have learned in the previous sections, but it also does them on a much
larger scale. This will allow you to automate data analysis so that you can
effectively navigate large datasets that might be cumbersome to navigate by
hand.

You can use SQL to analyze anything from stock market prices of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (DOW) over the last fifty years to patient data at a major
hospital. If you can make a database out of some information, you can use SQL to
store and analyze it. In addition, SQL allows you to share data and reorganize
data from different datasets. In this next chapter, you will learn the basics of
SQL so that you can efficiently navigate a database!
